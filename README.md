# BMWphevBMS_T4
This is a modified version of SimpBMS for BMWphev to run on a Teensy 4.0 board.
Pins 22 and 23 were changed to pin 3/4 as 22/23 are used for CAN1 on Teensy 4.0.
CAN and serial functions ( consol and Nextion display ) were tested on the VW version but have not been tested for BMW version.
